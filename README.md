# Madison County Schools Registration Project

Created a data entry form in Java for a fictional county of schools named Madison County Schools.  Considered many GUI design guidelines while creating this project.
Used several design choices such as the choice of interface objects/controls, along wiht their design and layout.
Also used several implementation guidlines to create things such as variable names, program documentation, code, input validation/verification and accuracy of calculations.

## Validation

1. Used Input Masks and/or Input Verifiers when approriate
2. For numeric fields, made sure that the numbers are valid in some reasonable range
3. If invalid input is given for dates or ages, immediately alerted the user by popping up error messages
4. Clearly indicated required fields. Before allowing the user to move to the next tab, if any required data is missing,
popped up an error message and highlighted the label of the missing data in red.

##Features
1. In the financial tab, showed the total of all income, the total of all expenses, and the total net income
2. Included tooltips throughout the entire applicaiton
3. Provided auto-fill where applicable
4. Inactivated/greyed-out itmes/controls where it made sense
